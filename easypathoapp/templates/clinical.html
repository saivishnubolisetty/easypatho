<p><h4>
Clinical Biochemistry publishes articles relating to clinical chemistry,
 molecular biology and genetics, therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicology,
 laboratory immunology and laboratory medicine in general, with the focus 
 on analytical and clinical investigation of laboratory tests in humans
 used for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and therapy, and monitoring 
 of disease.<br/>
Laboratory Medicine Division The Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory provides
 an extensive range of testing services to all medical center departments
 and clinics, other hospitals, HMOs, the army, individuals, and research 
 institutions. The lab also provides testing for research laboratories 
 and skilled researchers at the Medical Center.
Lab research studies are conducted by hospital staff and Tel Aviv
 University masterâ€™s degree students in collaboration with laboratory
 management. The lab also develops and perfects unique laboratory testing
 methods.<br/>
<b>The lab is equipped with:</b></br>
